# vibration-analysis-interface
A full stack project for the analysis of vibration data using time and frequency techniques applied on public dataset signals.

## Development tools used in this project
- FastAPI: backend.
- Docker: image containerization.
- Jenkins: CI/CD pipeline.

## Vibration analysis techniques used in this project
- Statistical analysis (RMS, variance, peak-to-peak).
- Frequency-domain analysis (fast Fourier transform).

## Downloading the vibration datasets
In order to obtain the datasets for testing the application, please access the
following shared folder, download and paste the available folders into
the directory "vibration-analisis-interface/app/datasets".
