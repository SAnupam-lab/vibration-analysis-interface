A full stack project for the analysis of vibration signals using time and frequency techniques applied on public dataset signals.

## Development tools used in this project
- FastAPI: backend
- React: frontend
- Docker: image containerization
- Jenkins: CI/CD pipeline

## Vibration analysis techniques used in this project
- Statistical analysis (RMS, variance, peak-to-peak)
- Frequency-domain analysis (fast Fourier transform)
